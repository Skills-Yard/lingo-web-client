 * appear. Serving the binary from `/public` lets it download in parallel

 * layout/copy differences only, not the mascot's own art anymore) —
 * RobuMascot (the single persistent mascot that glides between every
 * screen's anchor in the main flow: its boot-up intro sequence plays once,
 * in place of a CSS/framer opacity+scale fade, before the same file settles
 * into Robu's ambient idle loop for the rest of the session) and every
 * standalone `<RobuEyeBlink>` (the reveal-card modal, the game screens'

 *
 * One file for both themes (unlike `ROBU_RIVE_SRC_LIGHT`/`_DARK` below) — no
 * `getRobuRiveSrc(theme)` lookup needed, just this constant.
 *
 * `-3`: adds a second, separate state machine ("splash screen") that drives
 * Robu's boot-up sequence on its own — internally chaining its own
 * "mouth idle " -> "mouth idle to hi " -> "hi " -> "mouth hi to idle " ->
 * "mouth idle "/"idle " clips, the same automatic (no-input) transition
 * pattern the original rig's single state machine used to use for its own
 * boot chain. RobuMascot now plays *that* state machine at mount instead of
 * the raw "hi " clip; "hi " itself moved to the greeting wave (see
 * useGreetingOverlay) that plays once screen 1's bubble shows. Every other
 * clip/artboard name is unchanged from the previous file.
 *
 * `-4`: renames the default state machine "State Machine 1" -> "Idle state"
 * and adds "laptop idle" / "tail idle" clips; "splash screen" and every clip
 * name the components play are unchanged from `-3`.
 *
 * `-5`: renames the talking clip "speak " -> "speak" (no trailing space) and
 * makes it the "Idle state" state machine's mouth-layer entry state; every
 * other clip/state-machine name is unchanged from `-4`.
